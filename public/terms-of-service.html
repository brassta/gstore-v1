        <h4>Terms and Conditions for play.gn.org</h4>
        <p>
          1. The following terms and conditions (hereinafter “<b>Agreement</b>” or “<b>Terms and Conditions</b>”) are
          meant to regulate the relations between DA Creation Pte. Ltd., 176 Joo Chiat Road, #02-02, Singapore 427447

          </br></br>
          You are able to use the Service only if you have registered your personal account on account.gn.org
          (“<b>Platform Account</b>”). Once Your account is active and you start to use the Service you agree to this
          Agreement. If you do not agree to be bound by this Agreement, do not use the Service.
          </br></br>

          tournaments with other Users. There are two types of games that you can play on play.gn.org. First type are
          head-to-head games, where you will compete against one User, and the second type of games are multi-player
          games, where you are competing against two or more other users (collectively referred as to the “<b>Games</b>”). The
          Games are skill-based and there is no chance element to them. Therefore, when playing a head-to-head game or
          participating in a tournament with other Users it is your skill in playing a certain game that is evaluated
          against other Users, and the winner will be the User who, through skill, scores the most points in the
          relevant game. You should get acquainted with each game, by reading the rules and instructions before you
          play.
          </br></br>
          3. Majority of the Games are entrance-free games. To be able to play these Games you are not obliged to pay
          the entrance fee and in case of certain types of Games (e.g. leaderboard tournaments), you will receive a
          reward in case you win.
          </br></br>
          4. The entrance fee for playing of certain Games is expressed exclusively in GN Gold (the “<b>Gold</b>”). In case of
          head-to-head games, the users determine the entrance fee by themselves, whilst in case of multi-player games
          (i.e. tournaments) the entrance fee is prescribed in advance and shall be presented at the beginning of each
          tournament. <i>For more information on the Gold, please read once more the Terms and Conditions for our GNation

          reward. In case of head-to-head game, the reward will depend on the entry fee that is set between the users.

          beginning of each tournament.
          </br></br>

          tournament can be expressed either in Gold or in MGO token.
          </br></br>
          7. In case you win a reward in Gold, the number of received Gold shall be recorded on your Platform Account
          and you can use them for any Platform Service and eventually outside the Platform.
